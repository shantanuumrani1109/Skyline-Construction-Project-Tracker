### **Description of the Data Model**

The visual represents a data model built in **Power BI**, designed for tracking project tasks and budgets over time. It consists of four main tables‚Äî**Dataset**, **Calendar**, **Task Measures**, and **Budget Measures**‚Äîeach serving a specific role in data analysis and reporting.

#### **1. Dataset Table**
The `Dataset` table acts as the **primary fact table** containing detailed records of project tasks and financials. It includes:

- **Task Details**: such as `Task ID`, `Task Name`, `Assigned To`, `Task Status`, `Priority`, and `Comments`.
- **Project Information**: including `Project Name` and `Site Location`.
- **Date Fields**: such as `Start Date`, `Due Date`, and `Completion Date` to track timelines.
- **Progress Tracking**: through fields like `Progress %`, `Expected Days`, and `Materials Used`.
- **Financial Fields**: such as `Budget Amount ($)` and `Amount Spent ($)` to monitor resource allocation.

#### **2. Calendar Table**
The `Calendar` table functions as a **date dimension table** to enable time-based analysis. It provides:

- Granular date-related attributes such as `Date`, `Month`, `Month Number`, and `Year`.
- A **one-to-many relationship** is established from the `Calendar` table to the `Dataset` table using the `Date` field, supporting efficient time intelligence calculations like monthly trends and year-to-date progress.

#### **3. Task Measures Table**
This table holds **calculated measures (KPIs)** related to task progress and completion. It includes:

- Percentages like `% Completed`, `% Not Started`, and `% Progress`.
- Relative progress metrics: `R % Completed`, `R % Not Started`, and `R % Progress`.
- Aggregates: `Total Completed Tasks` and `Total Tasks`.

These measures help in visualizing how tasks are progressing and identifying bottlenecks.

#### **4. Budget Measures Table**
This table provides **budget-related KPIs** and calculations, helping stakeholders manage financial performance. It includes:

- Financial metrics like `Amount Spent`, `Balance`, and `% Remaining Budget`.
- Budget utilization fields: `Budget Utilization %`, `CF Budget`, and `CF Remaining Budget`.
- Other descriptors: `CF Project Name`, `Title`, and `Placeholder`.

These fields enable effective monitoring of budget consumption and balance for various projects.

  <img src="Images/DAX-Calculations.png" alt="üßÆ DAX Calculations" width="100%">
</p>

## üìÖ Custom Table: 

#### 1. Calendar

```
Calendar = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDARAUTO(), "Year", YEAR([Date]), "Month", FORMAT([Date], "mmm"), "Month Number", MONTH([Date]))
```
**üìå Description:**
This DAX formula creates a dynamic calendar table using CALENDARAUTO(), which automatically detects the date range from the data model. It enriches the table with additional columns:
- Year ‚Äì Extracts the year from each date.
- Month ‚Äì Extracts the short month name (e.g., Jan, Feb).
- Month Number ‚Äì Provides the month as a number (1 to 12).
The calendar table is essential for implementing time intelligence functions such as filtering, grouping, and time-based calculations (YTD, MTD, QTD, etc.).

#### 2. Task Measures

```
Task Measures = DATATABLE("Name", STRING, {{"Measure Placeholder"}})
```
**üìå Description:**
This DAX formula creates a placeholder table named Task Measures, which acts as a container for storing all task-related DAX measures.
- DATATABLE creates a static table with a single column Name and one dummy row "Measure Placeholder".
- The placeholder row can be deleted later; the table's sole purpose is to group related measures like % Completed, % In Progress, % Not Started, etc.
- Helps maintain clean data modeling and improves readability by organizing all task KPIs in one dedicated table.
- Useful for dashboards that focus on project tracking, task lifecycle, and performance metrics.

#### 3. Budget Measures

```
Budget Measures = DATATABLE("Name", STRING, {{"Measure Placeholder"}})
```
**üìå Description:**
This DAX formula sets up a dedicated table called Budget Measures, which is used solely to house budget-related DAX measures.
- Like the Task Measures table, it uses a dummy row with DATATABLE and column "Name", which can be removed once actual measures are created.
- It becomes a centralized location for all KPIs related to budget analysis such as:
  - Total Budget
  - Amount Spent
  - Balance
  - Budget Utilization %
  - % Remaining Budget
- Enables clean model organization and intuitive grouping for use in finance dashboards, budget vs actual visuals, and resource planning reports.
